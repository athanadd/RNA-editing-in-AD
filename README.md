# RNA Editing in AD
A repo to store the code used in the RNA editing analysis.

The repo contains information about the process and all the functions used to perform an RNA editing analysis
on the Satoh (2014) RNA-seq data.

The scripts can be found in the "scripts" folder. The first number indicates the sequence of the scripts used.
The scripts can be downloaded and run with modifications to suit the data needs.

The workflow can be separated in 6 sections:

1. Quality Control
2. Alignment and Variants Calling
3. Strand Correction and Filtering
4. Differential Gene Expression
5. Differential RNA Editing
6. Pathway Analysis and Annotation of KEGG pathways

The first two steps are carried out by Bash scripts, while the others are executed entirely in R.

## Quality Control

## Alignment and Variants Calling

## Strand Correction and Filtering

## Differential Gene Expression
